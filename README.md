# UNYA Aalborg

United Nations Youth Association of Aalborg, Denmark.

## Who Are We?

We are a diverse student-run, non-profit organization seeking to educate
young people about the purpose of the United Nations and the importance
of human rights, as well as promote and encourage UN values.

## Why Github?

We are a not for-profit organization that's mostly fueled by the good will
of our volunteers, giving their time and effort for free. So we are
choosing Github to host our technical contributions. The website
is open source and licensed under MIT.
